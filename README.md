# Arduino LED Control with Keypad

This project demonstrates controlling LEDs using a keypad with an Arduino. Each key on the keypad performs a different function, allowing you to turn on/off all LEDs, toggle individual LEDs, or enter a blink mode.

## Components

- Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
- 4x4 Keypad
- 6 LEDs
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
